# BlogFormatter

Roughly a million years ago, I made a blogging engine and I needed a way to translate simple, mostly plain text into HTML for the body of the posts. I tried Markdown and didn't care for it, I tried Textile and thought it was okay, but both were more than I really needed. So I wrote this.

It's old, it's hacky, but it works well enough for my needs.

<p><span class="caps">NPR</span> has a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94481288">great overview</a> of the current scandal/gate/tempest-in-a-teapot brewing in US politics. Hearing more of Obama&#8217;s speech, it&#8217;s clear that the &#8220;pig&#8221; comment refers to his &#8220;that&#8217;s not change&#8221; riff. Out of context, I guess it&#8217;s easier to associate the comment with the &#8220;hockey moms vs. pit-bulls&#8221; &#8220;joke&#8221; from Palin&#8217;s convention speech.</p>
<p>Anyway, the piece from <span class="caps">NPR</span> references &#8220;lipstick on a pig&#8221; comments made in times past, including quotes from Vice President Dick Cheney, Representative Charles Rangel, and <strong>Senator John McCain</strong>.</p>
<p>Um, Candidate McCain? Senator McCain would like to have a word with you.</p>

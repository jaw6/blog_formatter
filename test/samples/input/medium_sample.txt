    <p>A group, <a href="http://www.pnhp.org">Physicians for a National Health Program</a>, has an interesting <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2008/january/doctors_give_massach.php">press release</a>, distilled from an &#8220;open letter&#8221; signed by 250 doctors in Massachussets. (I learned about it from <a href="http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/mitts_health_plan_debunked.php?page=all"><span class="caps">CJR</span></a>, which says that it&#8217;s not getting any media coverage.)</p>

    <p>The ostensible goal of the program is to &#8220;provide residents with medical insurance&#8221;, that is, by <strong>requiring</strong> them to pay for health insurance. If they don&#8217;t, they will be fined. If they&#8217;re a certain distance below the poverty line, there&#8217;s a tax refund for the insurance. Employers who don&#8217;t provide health insurance to their employees are also fined.</p>
